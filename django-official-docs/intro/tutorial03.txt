创作你的第一个Django app, part 3
=====================================

本教程紧接:doc:`Tutorial 2 </intro/tutorial02>` 之后。
我们继续Web-poll 应用，并将目光聚焦在创建公共接口-- "views."

概述
========

在Django应用中，视图是一类通常服务于特定功能并且具有特定模板的Web页面。
比如，在博客应用中，可能会有下列的视图：

* 博客首页 -- 显示最新的几篇文章.

* 实体 "detail" 页面 -- 单独一篇文章的永久链接页面。

* 基于年的归档页面 -- 显示给定年份的各月份文章。

* 基于月的归档页面 -- 显示给定月份的各天文章。

* 基于日的归档页面 -- 显示给定日期的所有文章。

* 留言动作 -- 处理发送留言到给定的文章。

在poll应用中，我们将拥有下列的视图：

* 问题首页 -- 显示最新的问题。

* 问题“详细”页 -- 显示问题文本，没有结果，但是提供一个表单去投票。

* 问题“结果”页 -- 显示特定问题的投票结果。

* 投票动作 -- 处理在给定问题下投票。

在Django中，网页和其他内容由视图传递。每一个视图由一个简单的Python函数（或者叫方法，在基于类的视图中）来表示。
Django根据url请求（准确来说，就是url中域名后面的那部分）选定一个视图。


现在你在网络上可能会遇到如
"ME2/Sites/dirmod.asp?sid=&type=gen&mod=Core+Pages&gid=A6CD4967199A42D9B65B1B"一样的url。
你将会了解到Django拥有比那更优雅的URL模式。


URL模式只是URL的一般形式 - 比如：
``/newsarchive/<year>/<month>/``。

To get from a URL to a view, Django uses what are known as 'URLconfs'. A
URLconf maps URL patterns to views.

This tutorial provides basic instruction in the use of URLconfs, and you can
refer to :doc:`/topics/http/urls` for more information.

Writing more views
==================

Now let's add a few more views to ``polls/views.py``. These views are
slightly different, because they take an argument:

.. snippet::
    :文件名: polls/views.py

    def detail(request, question_id):
        return HttpResponse("You're looking at question %s." % question_id)

    def results(request, question_id):
        response = "You're looking at the results of question %s."
        return HttpResponse(response % question_id)

    def vote(request, question_id):
        return HttpResponse("You're voting on question %s." % question_id)

通过加入下面的:func:`~django.urls.path`调用，将这些新的试图导入 ``polls.urls`` 模块中：

.. snippet::
    :filename: polls/urls.py

    from django.urls import path

    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        # ex: /polls/
        path('', views.index, name='index'),
        # ex: /polls/5/
        path('<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
        # ex: /polls/5/results/
        path('<int:question_id>/results/', views.results, name='results'),
        # ex: /polls/5/vote/
        path('<int:question_id>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote'),
    ]

观察你的浏览器，"/polls/34/"这个URL。它将运行detail()方法，并且可以显示你给定的任何id的信息。
再试试"/polls/34/results/" 和 "/polls/34/vote/"  -- 他们将显示占位符的投票结果和投票页面。

当有人从你的网站请求页面 -- 输入 "/polls/34/", Django
will load the ``mysite.urls`` Python module because it's pointed to by the
:setting:`ROOT_URLCONF` setting. It finds the variable named ``urlpatterns``
and traverses the patterns in order. After finding the match at ``'polls/'``,
it strips off the matching text (``"polls/"``) and sends the remaining text --
``"34/"`` -- to the 'polls.urls' URLconf for further processing. There it
matches ``'<int:question_id>/'``, resulting in a call to the ``detail()`` view
like so::

    detail(request=<HttpRequest object>, question_id=34)

The ``question_id=34`` part comes from ``<int:question_id>``. Using angle
brackets "captures" part of the URL and sends it as a keyword argument to the
view function. The ``:question_id>`` part of the string defines the name that
will be used to identify the matched pattern, and the ``<int:`` part is a
converter that determines what patterns should match this part of the URL path.

There's no need to add URL cruft such as ``.html`` -- unless you want to, in
which case you can do something like this::

    path('polls/latest.html', views.index),

But, don't do that. It's silly.

Write views that actually do something
======================================

Each view is responsible for doing one of two things: returning an
:class:`~django.http.HttpResponse` object containing the content for the
requested page, or raising an exception such as :exc:`~django.http.Http404`. The
rest is up to you.

Your view can read records from a database, or not. It can use a template
system such as Django's -- or a third-party Python template system -- or not.
It can generate a PDF file, output XML, create a ZIP file on the fly, anything
you want, using whatever Python libraries you want.

All Django wants is that :class:`~django.http.HttpResponse`. Or an exception.

Because it's convenient, let's use Django's own database API, which we covered
in :doc:`Tutorial 2 </intro/tutorial02>`. Here's one stab at a new ``index()``
view, which displays the latest 5 poll questions in the system, separated by
commas, according to publication date:

.. snippet::
    :filename: polls/views.py

    from django.http import HttpResponse

    from .models import Question


    def index(request):
        latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
        output = ', '.join([q.question_text for q in latest_question_list])
        return HttpResponse(output)

    # Leave the rest of the views (detail, results, vote) unchanged

There's a problem here, though: the page's design is hard-coded in the view. If
you want to change the way the page looks, you'll have to edit this Python code.
So let's use Django's template system to separate the design from Python by
creating a template that the view can use.

First, create a directory called ``templates`` in your ``polls`` directory.
Django will look for templates in there.

Your project's :setting:`TEMPLATES` setting describes how Django will load and
render templates. The default settings file configures a ``DjangoTemplates``
backend whose :setting:`APP_DIRS <TEMPLATES-APP_DIRS>` option is set to
``True``. By convention ``DjangoTemplates`` looks for a "templates"
subdirectory in each of the :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`.

Within the ``templates`` directory you have just created, create another
directory called ``polls``, and within that create a file called
``index.html``. In other words, your template should be at
``polls/templates/polls/index.html``. Because of how the ``app_directories``
template loader works as described above, you can refer to this template within
Django simply as ``polls/index.html``.

.. admonition:: Template namespacing

    Now we *might* be able to get away with putting our templates directly in
    ``polls/templates`` (rather than creating another ``polls`` subdirectory),
    but it would actually be a bad idea. Django will choose the first template
    it finds whose name matches, and if you had a template with the same name
    in a *different* application, Django would be unable to distinguish between
    them. We need to be able to point Django at the right one, and the easiest
    way to ensure this is by *namespacing* them. That is, by putting those
    templates inside *another* directory named for the application itself.

Put the following code in that template:

.. snippet:: html+django
    :filename: polls/templates/polls/index.html

    {% if latest_question_list %}
        <ul>
        {% for question in latest_question_list %}
            <li><a href="/polls/{{ question.id }}/">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% else %}
        <p>No polls are available.</p>
    {% endif %}

Now let's update our ``index`` view in ``polls/views.py`` to use the template:

.. snippet::
    :filename: polls/views.py

    from django.http import HttpResponse
    from django.template import loader

    from .models import Question


    def index(request):
        latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
        template = loader.get_template('polls/index.html')
        context = {
            'latest_question_list': latest_question_list,
        }
        return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))

That code loads the template called  ``polls/index.html`` and passes it a
context. The context is a dictionary mapping template variable names to Python
objects.

Load the page by pointing your browser at "/polls/", and you should see a
bulleted-list containing the "What's up" question from :doc:`Tutorial 2
</intro/tutorial02>`. The link points to the question's detail page.

A shortcut: :func:`~django.shortcuts.render`
--------------------------------------------

It's a very common idiom to load a template, fill a context and return an
:class:`~django.http.HttpResponse` object with the result of the rendered
template. Django provides a shortcut. Here's the full ``index()`` view,
rewritten:

.. snippet::
    :filename: polls/views.py

    from django.shortcuts import render

    from .models import Question


    def index(request):
        latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
        context = {'latest_question_list': latest_question_list}
        return render(request, 'polls/index.html', context)

Note that once we've done this in all these views, we no longer need to import
:mod:`~django.template.loader` and :class:`~django.http.HttpResponse` (you'll
want to keep ``HttpResponse`` if you still have the stub methods for ``detail``,
``results``, and ``vote``).

The :func:`~django.shortcuts.render` function takes the request object as its
first argument, a template name as its second argument and a dictionary as its
optional third argument. It returns an :class:`~django.http.HttpResponse`
object of the given template rendered with the given context.

Raising a 404 error
===================

Now, let's tackle the question detail view -- the page that displays the question text
for a given poll. Here's the view:

.. snippet::
    :filename: polls/views.py

    from django.http import Http404
    from django.shortcuts import render

    from .models import Question
    # ...
    def detail(request, question_id):
        try:
            question = Question.objects.get(pk=question_id)
        except Question.DoesNotExist:
            raise Http404("Question does not exist")
        return render(request, 'polls/detail.html', {'question': question})

The new concept here: The view raises the :exc:`~django.http.Http404` exception
if a question with the requested ID doesn't exist.

We'll discuss what you could put in that ``polls/detail.html`` template a bit
later, but if you'd like to quickly get the above example working, a file
containing just:

.. snippet:: html+django
    :filename: polls/templates/polls/detail.html

    {{ question }}

will get you started for now.

A shortcut: :func:`~django.shortcuts.get_object_or_404`
-------------------------------------------------------

It's a very common idiom to use :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.get`
and raise :exc:`~django.http.Http404` if the object doesn't exist. Django
provides a shortcut. Here's the ``detail()`` view, rewritten:

.. snippet::
    :filename: polls/views.py

    from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render

    from .models import Question
    # ...
    def detail(request, question_id):
        question = get_object_or_404(Question, pk=question_id)
        return render(request, 'polls/detail.html', {'question': question})

The :func:`~django.shortcuts.get_object_or_404` function takes a Django model
as its first argument and an arbitrary number of keyword arguments, which it
passes to the :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.get` function of the
model's manager. It raises :exc:`~django.http.Http404` if the object doesn't
exist.

.. admonition:: Philosophy

    Why do we use a helper function :func:`~django.shortcuts.get_object_or_404`
    instead of automatically catching the
    :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.ObjectDoesNotExist` exceptions at a higher
    level, or having the model API raise :exc:`~django.http.Http404` instead of
    :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.ObjectDoesNotExist`?

    Because that would couple the model layer to the view layer. One of the
    foremost design goals of Django is to maintain loose coupling. Some
    controlled coupling is introduced in the :mod:`django.shortcuts` module.

There's also a :func:`~django.shortcuts.get_list_or_404` function, which works
just as :func:`~django.shortcuts.get_object_or_404` -- except using
:meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.filter` instead of
:meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.get`. It raises
:exc:`~django.http.Http404` if the list is empty.

Use the template system
=======================

Back to the ``detail()`` view for our poll application. Given the context
variable ``question``, here's what the ``polls/detail.html`` template might look
like:

.. snippet:: html+django
    :filename: polls/templates/polls/detail.html

    <h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1>
    <ul>
    {% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}
        <li>{{ choice.choice_text }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

The template system uses dot-lookup syntax to access variable attributes. In
the example of ``{{ question.question_text }}``, first Django does a dictionary lookup
on the object ``question``. Failing that, it tries an attribute lookup -- which
works, in this case. If attribute lookup had failed, it would've tried a
list-index lookup.

Method-calling happens in the :ttag:`{% for %}<for>` loop:
``question.choice_set.all`` is interpreted as the Python code
``question.choice_set.all()``, which returns an iterable of ``Choice`` objects and is
suitable for use in the :ttag:`{% for %}<for>` tag.

See the :doc:`template guide </topics/templates>` for more about templates.

Removing hardcoded URLs in templates
====================================

Remember, when we wrote the link to a question in the ``polls/index.html``
template, the link was partially hardcoded like this:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <li><a href="/polls/{{ question.id }}/">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>

The problem with this hardcoded, tightly-coupled approach is that it becomes
challenging to change URLs on projects with a lot of templates. However, since
you defined the name argument in the :func:`~django.urls.path` functions in
the ``polls.urls`` module, you can remove a reliance on specific URL paths
defined in your url configurations by using the ``{% url %}`` template tag:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <li><a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>

The way this works is by looking up the URL definition as specified in the
``polls.urls`` module. You can see exactly where the URL name of 'detail' is
defined below::

    ...
    # the 'name' value as called by the {% url %} template tag
    path('<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
    ...

If you want to change the URL of the polls detail view to something else,
perhaps to something like ``polls/specifics/12/`` instead of doing it in the
template (or templates) you would change it in ``polls/urls.py``::

    ...
    # added the word 'specifics'
    path('specifics/<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
    ...

Namespacing URL names
======================

The tutorial project has just one app, ``polls``. In real Django projects,
there might be five, ten, twenty apps or more. How does Django differentiate
the URL names between them? For example, the ``polls`` app has a ``detail``
view, and so might an app on the same project that is for a blog. How does one
make it so that Django knows which app view to create for a url when using the
``{% url %}`` template tag?

The answer is to add namespaces to your  URLconf. In the ``polls/urls.py``
file, go ahead and add an ``app_name`` to set the application namespace:

.. snippet::
    :filename: polls/urls.py

    from django.urls import path

    from . import views

    app_name = 'polls'
    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.index, name='index'),
        path('<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
        path('<int:question_id>/results/', views.results, name='results'),
        path('<int:question_id>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote'),
    ]

Now change your ``polls/index.html`` template from:

.. snippet:: html+django
    :filename: polls/templates/polls/index.html

    <li><a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>

to point at the namespaced detail view:

.. snippet:: html+django
    :filename: polls/templates/polls/index.html

    <li><a href="{% url 'polls:detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>

When you're comfortable with writing views, read :doc:`part 4 of this tutorial
